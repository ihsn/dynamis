Parameter Generation
====================

All DYNAMIS-POP parameters are generated by running this set of R scripts. Most parameters are calculated or estimated based on micro-data files. The first script is country/version specific and sets up all R objects based on specific country data files. Files for an imaginary country ABC can be downloaded from this site. All other scripts are generic and work for all country contexts. The scripts 2-15 produce a total of 14 parameter files in Modgen .dat format. Each of these files contains the set of parameters belonging to a specific module.
