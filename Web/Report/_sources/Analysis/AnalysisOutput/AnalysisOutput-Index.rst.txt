Output Analysis
===============

DYNAMIS-POP output based on simulated micro-data is generated by running this set of R scripts. The first script is country/version specific and sets up all R objects based on specific country data files. Files for an imaginary country ABC can be downloaded from this site. All other scripts are generic and work for all country contexts.
