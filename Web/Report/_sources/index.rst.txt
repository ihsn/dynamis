Welcome to DYNAMIS-POP!
=======================

DYNAMIS-POP is a portable dynamic micro-simulation platform allowing to create realistic data-driven simulations with emphasis on applications addressing development issues. It is based on data readily available for most developing countries. As a highly modular system it can be adapted and refined for specific uses in a broad fields of policy-relevant applications. DYNAMIS-POP supports the interaction between people as well as interactions between people and the environment. In addition, DYNAMIS-POP supports the alignment of aggregated outcomes to existing demographic projections.
